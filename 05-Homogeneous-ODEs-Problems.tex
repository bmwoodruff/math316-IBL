*The problems in these sections are quick problems. It is important to do lots of them to learn the pattern used to solve ODEs. You may be able to finish 7 or more problems in 15 minutes or less.  Please a bunch so that when you encounter these kinds of problems in the future you can immediately give an answer and move forward.
